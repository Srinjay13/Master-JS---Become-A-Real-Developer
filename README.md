# Master-JS — Become A Real Developer

A compact, personal set of notes distilled from a Sheriyans Coding School tutorial to help you quickly review essential DOM and browser APIs. These notes are my own summary of the lecture for future revision — all credit goes to Sheriyans Coding School.

### About the Notes
This repo focuses on practical browser-side JavaScript topics you’ll use daily when building web apps or preparing for interviews:

- **The DOM and DOM Manipulation**  
- **Events and Event Handling**  
- **Forms and Form Validation**  
- **Timers and Intervals**  
- **LocalStorage, SessionStorage and Cookies**

Each topic contains concise explanations, annotated code snippets, and small examples you can run in the browser console.

---

### What You Will Learn
- **DOM and DOM Manipulation**  
  - Selecting elements, traversing the DOM, creating and removing nodes, and updating attributes and styles.

- **Events and Event Handling**  
  - Event listeners, event propagation, delegation, and best practices for performance and accessibility.

- **Forms and Form Validation**  
  - Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs, validation patterns, HTML5 validation attributes, and custom validation flows.

- **Timers and Intervals**  
  - `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, clearing timers, and common timing patterns for UI updates.

- **LocalStorage SessionStorage and Cookies**  
  - Persistent and session storage usage, serialization with JSON, cookie basics, and when to use each storage mechanism.

---

### Technologies and Tools
- **JavaScript ES6+** — primary language for examples and snippets  
- **Browser Console** — recommended for experimenting with snippets  
- **Code Editor** — VS Code or any editor you prefer

---

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Master-JS-Become-A-Real-Developer.git
```
2. Open the markdown or example files in your editor.  
3. Run snippets in the browser console or create a simple `index.html` to test behaviors live.

Each markdown file contains:  
- **Clear explanations** with short code snippets  
- **Quick examples** to paste into the console  
- **Notes and gotchas** for interview prep

---

### Study Tips
- **Run examples** in the browser console to see behavior live.  
- **Annotate** snippets with your own comments to reinforce understanding.  
- **Build tiny projects**: a todo app using localStorage, a form with custom validation, or a UI that uses event delegation.  
- **Teach back**: explain a concept aloud or write a short summary to lock it in.

### Contributing
This repo is primarily for personal revision, but contributions are welcome:  
- Add clearer examples or edge-case notes  
- Include visual diagrams for event propagation and scope chains  
- Add interview-style questions and solutions
